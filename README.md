What is an arbitrage opportunities?
When the **highest seller** and **lowest bidder** has a price difference and when a third person comes in **buy** it from the seller and sells it to bidder and the **profit** that particular person makes in this traction.

suppose David is selling a stock at Rs.10 and Rahul makes an offer of Rs.12 and Ankur comes in buys it from David and sells it to Rahul. The 2 Rupees profit he makes during the transcition is an Arbitrage opportunity.

Our Task is to find this particular situation, using the data we have been provided and see how much profit one can make.

The code of this nothing more than the if-else statement.
